# MSc Project - Poker Game
A single player web-based poker game. Final version can be viewed at http://lyncz.co.uk/poker-game/

## Instructions
Go to the root folder where you found this readme file (in my home directory on campus computers).

Open a commandline tool (i.e. powershell) in this directory and type 'npm start'.

The server will start and open localhost:8080 in the browser.

If that doesn't load, go to http://raptor.kent.ac.uk:8081/~RL394/

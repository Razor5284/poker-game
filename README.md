# MSc Project - Poker Game
A single player web-based poker game

## Instructions
Go to the root folder where you found this readme file (in my home directory on campus computers).

Open powershell in this directory and type 'npm start'.

The server will start and open localhost:8080 in the browser.

If that doesn't load, go to http://raptor.kent.ac.uk:8081/~RL394/
